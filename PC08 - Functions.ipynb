    "In the previous chapter, the loop-and-a-half was explained. The final code for the example that was presented is given below, and I made the remark that there is still something ugly about this code, namely the fact that if `x` is smaller than zero or higher than 1000, the code still asks for `y` even when it can know that it has to ask a new value for `x`. I also remarked that you can resolve this in an easy way by using a function. Create a function and insert it in this code, so that this issue gets fixed. Also get rid of the `exit()` and thus the possible ugly output by introducing a `main()` function."

    "In statistics, the binomial coefficient indexed by `n` and `k` (often expressed as \"n over k\", whereby `n` must be bigger than or equal to `k`) is calculated as `n!/(k!*(n-k)!)`, whereby `n!` indicates the factorial of `n`. As I explained in the previous chapter: the factorial of a positive integer is that integer, multiplied by all positive integers that are lower (excluding zero). You write the factorial as the number with an exclamation mark after it. E.g., the factorial of 5 is `5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120`. If you diligently did the last chapter, you wrote some code for this. Write a function that calculates the binomial coefficient for its two parameters, and returns the value. Write the code in such a way that it can be used as a module by another program (i.e., put the tests of your program in a `main()` function that is called as explained in the section on modules)."
