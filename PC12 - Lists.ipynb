    "The sieve of Eratosthenes is a method to find all prime numbers between 1 and a given number using a list. This works as follows: Fill the list with the sequence of numbers from 1 to the highest number. Set the value of 1 to zero, as 1 is not prime. Now loop over the list. Find the next number on the list that is not zero, which, at the start, is the number 2. Now set all multiples of this number to zero. Then find the next number on the list that is not zero, which is 3. Set all multiples of this number to zero. Then the next number, which is 5 (because 4 has already been set to zero), and do the same thing again. Process all the numbers of the list in this way. When you have finished, the only numbers left on the list are primes. Use this method to determine all the primes between 1 and 100."

If the cell contains a battleship, the computer responds with \"You sunk my battleship!\", and removes the battleship from the cell (i.e., a second shot at the same cell is a miss).
