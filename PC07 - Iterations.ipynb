    "\"99 bottles of beer\" is a traditional song in the United States and Canada. It is popular to sing on long trips, as it has a very repetitive format which is easy to memorize, and can take a long time to sing. The song's simple lyrics are as follows: \"99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer. Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.\" The same verse is repeated, each time with one fewer bottle. The song is completed when the singer or singers reach zero. Write a program that generates all the verses of the song (though you might start a bit lower, for instance with 10 bottles). Make sure that your loop is not endless, and that you use the proper inflection for the word \"bottle\"."

    "Write a program that approximates the value of `pi` by using random numbers, as follows. Consider a square measuring 1 by 1. If you throw a dart into that square in a random location, the probability that it will have a distance of 1 or less to the lower left corner is `pi/4`. To see why that is, remember that the area of a circle with a radius of 1 is `pi`, so the area of a quarter circle is `pi/4`. Thus, if a dart lands in a random point in the square, the chance that it lands in the quarter circle with its centre at the lower left corner is `pi/4`. Therefore, if you throw `N` darts into the square, and `M` of those land inside a distance of 1 to the lower left corner, then `4M/N` approximates `pi` if `N` is very large. \n",

The output of your program should be a single floating point number, rounded to two decimals. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hint 1: You can follow two different approaches: either you simulate the behavior of one single Triangle Crawler and repeat that 100,000 times, or you start with a population of 100,000 triangle crawlers in point A, and divide these over variables that keep track of how many Triangles are in each point, each day, including the point that they came from (assigning a remaining odd Triangle Crawler to a randomly determined neighboring point). The first method is short and simple but slow, the second is long and complex but fast. You may use either method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint 2: Do not use 100,000 Triangle Crawlers in your first attempts. Start with 1000 (or even only 1), and only try it out with 100,000 once your program is more or less finished. Testing is much quicker with fewer Triangle Crawlers. 1000 Triangle Crawlers should be done in under a second, so if your program takes longer, you probably have created an endless loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint 3: I won't be too specific, but the final answer is somewhere between 1 and 5 days. If you get something outside that range, it is definitely wrong. You may try to determine the exact answer mathematically before starting on the exercise, which is doable though quite hard.\n",

    "In Python 3, the `range()` function is an iterator. This entails that it needs very little memory space: it only retains the last number generated, the step size, and the limit that it should reach. In Python 2 `range()` is implemented differently: it produces all the numbers of the range in memory at once. This means that a statement like `range(1000000000)` in Python 2 requires so much memory that it may very well crash the program. In Python 3, such issues do not exist. In Python 2 it is therefore recommended not to use `range()` for more than 10,000 numbers or so, while in Python 3 no restrictions exist."
